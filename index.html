        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Tharun Prabhakar, an AI enthusiast, machine learning engineer, and problem solver passionate about turning data into impactful solutions. 
            Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Yeshiva University's Katz School of Science and Health, 
            I thrive on developing intelligent systems that bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            With hands-on experience in deep learning, computer vision, and NLP, I've worked on diverse projects, including medical AI, targeted marketing models, and AI-driven safety solutions.
             My journey has taken me through model visualization, detection algorithms for healthcare applications, and fine-tuning state-of-the-art models like Tacotron2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond AI, I'm a gamer and soccer player, always seeking a challenge both on the field and in the lab. 
            Whether it's optimizing a neural network or perfecting a free kick, I believe in the power of dedication and continuous learning.
